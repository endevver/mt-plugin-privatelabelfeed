# Private Label Feed plugin for Movable Type

For nearly as long as blogs have been providing
[RSS](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html) and 
[Atom](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php)
feeds, sites like [Feedburner](http://feedburner.com) have been around to proxy
those feeds and provide statistics on how many users are is subscribed to the
feed.

For many users, pointing Feedburner at your feed and then linking to
Feedburner's copy of the feed is enough.

If, however you as the site owner want more control over the URL you use for
your feed, without sacrificing the features of Feedburner or other feed
proxies, then Private Label Feed is for you.

Private Label Feed publishes a private copy of the 'Feed - Recent Entries'
(Atom feed) file whenever that file is published. This private feed file
(`atom-private.xml`) is the file you point your feed proxy service at. Then,
you will create an `.htaccess` rule (described below) to redirect requests for
`atom.xml` to your service of choice.

## Prerequisites

* Movable Type 4.x
* [Config Assistant](https://github.com/openmelody/mt-plugin-configassistant)

## Installation

The latest version of the plugin can be downloaded from its
[Github repo](https://github.com/sivy/mt-plugin-privatelabelfeed).

Installation follows the
[standard plugin installation](http://tinyurl.com/easy-plugin-install) procedures.

## Usage

* Install the plugin.
* In the blog you want to set up the feed for, go to the Tools menu and choose
  Plugins, then open the Settings for Private Label Feed.

* Enter the url for your Feedburner feed and hit Save
* Configure your `.htaccess` file to redirect `atom.xml` to your feedburner url:

    RewriteRule ^atom.xml$ http://feeds.feedburner.com/monkinetic-weblog [R]

* Or, if you're using an MT template to publish your `.htaccess` file:

    RewriteRule ^atom.xml$ &lt;mt:FeedburnerFeedURL> [R]

Now, if Feedburner (or your feed proxy of choice) ever goes away, you can
simply disable the plugin and remove the Apache rewrite, and your site goes
back to serving it's own `atom.xml` file, without any disruption to your users.
